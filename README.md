# Single-stage-speed-multiplier-design-and-sizing
The project involved designing a transmission system to be placed between a motor and a pulley with a radius of 12 mm, used to lift a 60 kN load at a speed of 1 m/s. The transmission system consists of a single-stage mechanical speed multiplier with external spur gears of involute profile and a conical friction clutch.
